### **1. Current Landscape of Wearable Health Metrics**

Wearables today dominate health tracking through **PPG** and **ECG** for metrics like heart rate, HRV, and sleep. However, they lack:

- **Mental and Emotional Health Metrics**: Current stress and focus measures rely on indirect proxies (e.g., HRV).
- **Accurate Sleep Analysis**: Motion and HRV-based sleep staging misses brain activity data.
- **Contextual Insights**: Metrics like HR or HRV lack integration with cognitive states for actionable recommendations.

| **Metric** | **Derived From** | **Applications** | **Limitations** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Heart Rate (HR)** | PPG | Cardiovascular health, stress | Susceptible to motion artifacts, lacks cognitive context. |
| **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** | PPG/ECG | Stress, recovery, sleep assessment | Limited accuracy without other biomarkers for context. |
| **Sleep Staging** | Motion + HR/HRV | Sleep duration, quality | Does not capture brain activity; lacks depth in staging. |
| **SpO2** | PPG | Oxygen levels, respiratory health | Limited for broader health insights. |
| **Activity Tracking** | Accelerometer + Gyroscope | Steps, calories, physical activity | Does not address mental or emotional health. |

### **2. The Need for EEG Integration**

Major players like **Apple, LG, and Samsung** are currently exploring **EEG integration** to address these gaps, but effective implementation will require:

1. **High-quality labeled datasets.**
2. **AI models to interpret complex EEG signals.**

This transition is expected to materialize in **3-5 years**, leaving a significant **AI and data gap** in the current ecosystem.

| **Key Application** | **Current Approach** | **With EEG Integration** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stress Monitoring** | HRV-derived stress scores | EEG captures stress biomarkers directly, combined with HRV trends. |
| **Focus and Relaxation** | Not measurable | EEG-derived alpha/beta ratio quantifies cognitive states. |
| **Sleep Staging** | Motion + HRV for estimating light/deep sleep | EEG detects brainwave patterns (delta, theta) for accurate staging. |
| **Emotional Well-being** | Not measurable | EEG-derived biomarkers detect arousal, anxiety, or calmness. |
